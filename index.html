      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hey how is it going my name is Terrence, I am from California born and raised, my two passions in life are
        technology and people and I am really excited to be taking this course because it allows me to work with both of
        them. I am excited to learn more about my teacher and peers and have them learn about me. Upon walking away from
        this course my hope is that I would have not only grown as a coder but that I would also grow my networking
        circle
        and my friends. </p>

      <h2>Education History</h2>
      <p>Codefellows will be the first formal coding course I have taken, although I do have informal courses under my
        belt
        from skillshare and youtube <i>(Where I learned nothing!!!)</i>, in the coding workspace. Outside of that I
        have,
        several online and inperson IT courses under my belt.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Job Experience</h2>
      <p>I have primarily worked in the Tech field my entire professional career briefly working as an apprentice to a
        website designer, and then moving into the Geek Squad as a Technician there, and then moving on to become a
        Technician and eventually owner at Omega Computer Consulting.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>My goals are to become a proficient programmer and software engineer and learn to perfect my trade well enough
        to
        teach it to others. I would also like to eventually become well-versed enough to work on cutting edge
        technologies,
        and create my own app development studio.</p>
