    <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header> 
    <p>Hey how is it going my name is Terrence, I am from California born and raised and really enjoy working in the tech field, in fact I have worked in and out of the tech field my entire life. I have always just felt most at home in this environment. I believe it comes from my natural disposition to be highly analytical. Where I have always failed is in my ability to be artistic, that is why I am learning to code because it is a challenging blend of the 2, I am hoping to become a master coder, and finally satisfy the artistic side of mine as well. Codefellows will be the first formal coding course I have taken, although I do have informal courses under my belt from skillshare and youtube <i>(Where I learned nothing!!!)</i> I am excited to finish this class beside all my peers and see us all go on to enter the coding space as junior developers! </p>
